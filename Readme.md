<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->

## About The Project

[![Project Screen Shot][project-screenshot]](https://github.com/AndrewJFleming/fleming-reeves-ecommerce)

This is a collaborative MERN stack project between Andrew Fleming and Cody Reeves. Our primary goal was to gain experience working in a team environment, using the Trello project management software for coordinating tasks for our weekly sprints. The initial release of the app was completed over the course of 4 week-long sprints.

Though both of us had experience with the MaterialUI CSS framework, a secondary goal for this collaborative project was to improve our skills working with the Material UI components, the styled-components feature as well as the custom theme feature.
